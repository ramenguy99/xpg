Installation:
- Source build:
    - Doable but fairly slow
    - If done through cmake add_subdirectory then debug/release matches the build (annoying during dev)
    - Also compiles slang-stdlib.bin on first use (can somehow disable this?)
    - can be useful for debugging slang itself but painful otherwise
    - Ok for python module because compiled only once, but still annoying for debug versions and for stdlib
- Binary releases:
    - Can potentially include / fetch binary releases from slang github
    - Likely much
- Vulkan SDK:
    - Dynamic lib (annoying)
    - No cmake (requires manually finding or getting there through SDK vars)
    - Likely an older version that was shipped with SDK (annoying because slang dev going fast)
