# TODO: logic related to shader loading:
# [ ] internal vs external shaders
# [ ] how are internal shaders compiled / shipped?
#     [ ] Do we use reflection and hot realoding for internal stuff? or only offered as a tool?
#     [ ] Do we have an exprt / development mode? Pre-exported definitely helps with first startup time
