[ ] Think about clean way to handle handedness / zy up conventions.
    -> wrap things that care in a separate module, make different default symbols base on config ?
    -> maybe math utils should expose both and a default, and only viewer stuff use config?

Viewer:
- [ ] Primitives
- [ ] Server
- [ ] Gui helpers
- [ ] Viewports
- [ ] Strong focus on extensions

- Ideas:
    - Generic viewer type with just basics + specialized viewer types for specific use cases (careful about composition vs specialization)
        - Scene viewer -> classic scene graph
            - Single frame viewer
            - Sequence viewer

Features (likely at viewer level with pyxpg helpers / wrappers (optional xpg features enabled on python release)):
- [ ] Meshoptimizer + meshlets
- [ ] Gaussian splats
- [ ] Ray marching / octrees
- [ ] Marching cubes
- [ ] Pointclouds
- [ ] Framegraph

Server:
-> 3 layers
    -> raw message (format, type, length, data)
    -> per format parser
    -> parsed message 
-> what about REST? it might be convenient to speak with the viewer direclty in rest, different API?
   wrap this API into a rest API? e.g. JSON for body is same as this, and type encoded in endpoint? seems doable
   -> what we have now will be a TcpServer, can also have an  HttpServer and maybe others too?, basically different ways to produce a RawMessage
